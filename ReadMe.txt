  Facial Recognition Based Attendance System
  
  The project is entitled a Facial recognition-based attendance system. This project had been
developed to replace the current manual student attendance management system with an
automated and efficient attendance tracking system.
Facial Recognition Based Attendance System is a machine learning-based system that handles
and tracks the student attendance system using the web application and deep learning
algorithms/models. Some of the main components of the system are recognizing the Student
Face and marking attendance of the recognized face. We have employed Deep Learning Models
which is the state of the art for Image Processing and Django Python Server-Side framework
for facial recognition and management purpose. We have utilized VGG-16 with transfer
learning for face recognition, VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model which achieved
92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet Dataset, MTCNN for face detection which can learn
multiple tasks at the same time, thus supporting the simultaneous detection of multiple faces.
This Facial recognition-based Attendance system tracks the attendance of the system using
both AI and form-based approaches and it is a real-time face recognition system that is capable
of identifying or verifying a student from a video frame. We have used 240 images of three
classes or students to train the model employing 20 - 80 approaches, 20% of the images for the
model validation and 80% for training.
